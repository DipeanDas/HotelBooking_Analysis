# üè® Hotel Booking Analysis

## üìå Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data from **City Hotels** and **Resort Hotels** to understand the factors affecting **reservation cancellations** and provide actionable insights to reduce them.  

High cancellation rates have been impacting hotel revenues and occupancy efficiency. The analysis explores booking patterns, pricing influence, seasonal trends, and customer booking sources to suggest strategies for improving profitability.

## üéØ Business Problem
Both City and Resort hotels face:
- High **cancellation rates** leading to vacant rooms.  
- Loss of **revenue efficiency** due to cancellations.  
- Difficulty in **forecasting demand** and making pricing decisions.  

**Objective:** Identify the key drivers of cancellations and provide strategies to reduce them.

## üìä Assumptions
1. Data from **2015‚Äì2017** is representative and unaffected by unusual events.  
2. Cancellation patterns in this dataset remain relevant for current hotel strategies.  
3. Cancellations directly translate into **vacant rooms** for the booked duration.  
4. Customers cancel bookings in the same year they are made.  
5. Hotels are not currently implementing the proposed solutions.  

## ‚ùì Research Questions

2. How can cancellations be reduced?  
3. How can this analysis assist in pricing and promotional decisions?  

## üìå Hypotheses
